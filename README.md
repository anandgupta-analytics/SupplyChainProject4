🧠 Harnessing the Slime Mould Algorithm for Supply Chain Optimization
📦 Project Title
Harnessing the Slime Mould Algorithm: Optimizing Supply Chain Logistics
Course Project – SCH-MGMT 663, MS in Business Analytics, UMass Amherst

📌 Overview
This project explores the Slime Mould Algorithm (SMA) — a nature-inspired metaheuristic — and its application in supply chain logistics. By modeling the foraging behavior of the Physarum Polycephalum, the SMA can identify optimal routes and resource allocation strategies in dynamic, constraint-heavy logistics environments.

🎯 Objectives
Investigate the mechanics and mathematical foundation of the SMA

Demonstrate its application in optimizing complex supply chain problems

Compare SMA with traditional routing and optimization approaches

Analyze real-world case studies to validate its practical utility

📈 Applications in Supply Chain
🚚 Route Optimization – Minimize delivery time and fuel costs

🧮 Inventory Optimization – Reduce holding and spoilage costs

🔄 Dynamic Traffic Management – Adapt to real-time disruptions

🧠 Predictive Modeling – Forecast demand cycles and adjust proactively

🧭 Network Design – Optimize layout of supply and distribution centers

⚙️ How SMA Works
The SMA simulates slime mould behavior via:

Chemotaxis – movement toward optimal conditions (e.g., food/nutrient)

Oscillation – exploration of solution space through back-and-forth movement

Adaptive Weighting – dynamic recalibration of agent priorities based on feedback

Exploration + Exploitation Balance – finds global optima while avoiding local traps
